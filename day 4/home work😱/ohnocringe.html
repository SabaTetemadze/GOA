<p>Clash Royale is a tower rush video game that puts players in games featuring <br>
    two or four players (1v1 or 2v2) in which the objective is to destroy more <br>
    towers than their opponent, with each destroyed tower being represented <br>
    as a "crown". Destruction of the opponent's "King's Tower" results in an <br>
    instantaneous "three-crown" victory. Matches last three minutes, and if both <br>
    of the players/teams have an equal number of crowns (or none at all) at that <br>
    point, the match continues into a two-minute overtime period. Here, the player <br>
    who destroys an opposing tower wins instantaneously. If no towers are <br>
    destroyed during overtime, there is a tiebreaker, where the towers with the <br>
    lowest amount of health points are destroyed. If both players have a tower <br>
    with the same least amount of health points, a draw is declared. In rare <br>
    instances, if the King's Tower is destroyed at the same time by both players, it <br>
    will also result in a draw.</p>
