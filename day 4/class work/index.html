    <p>Elon Reeve Musk is a businessman <br>
         and entrepreneur known for his leadership of Tesla, SpaceX, Twitter, and xAI.  <br>
         Musk has been the wealthiest person in the world since 2021; as of <br>
         October 2025, Forbes estimates his net worth to be US$500 billion.</p>
    <p>Born into a wealthy family in Pretoria, South Africa, Musk emigrated in 1989 <br>
        to Canada; he had obtained Canadian citizenship at birth through his <br>
        Canadian-born mother. He received bachelor's degrees in 1997 from the <br>
        University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, United States, before moving to <br>
        California to pursue business ventures. In 1995, Musk co-founded the <br>
        software company Zip2. Following its sale in 1999, he co-founded X.com, an <br>
        online payment company that later merged to form PayPal, which was <br>
        acquired by eBay in 2002. That year, Musk also became an American citizen</p>

    <h2>early life</h2>
        Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa's <br>
        administrative capital. He is of British and Pennsylvania Dutch <BR>
        ancestry. His mother, Maye (n√©e Haldeman), is a model and dietitian born <br>
        in Saskatchewan, Canada, and raised in South Africa. Musk therefore <br>
        holds both South African and Canadian citizenship from birth.[8] His father, <br>
        Errol Musk, is a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, <br>
        consultant, emerald dealer, and property developer, who partly owned a <br>
        rental lodge at Timbavati Private Nature Reserve.

    <h3>education</h3>
        <p>Musk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School, Bryanston High School, and <br>
        then Pretoria Boys High School, where he graduated. Musk was a good but <br>
        unexceptional student, earning a 61 in Afrikaans and a B on his senior math <br>
        certification. Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born <br>
        mother to avoid South Africa's mandatory military service, which would have <br>
        forced him to participate in the apartheid regime, as well as to <br>
        ease his path to immigration to the United States. While waiting for his application to be <br>
        processed, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months.</p>
